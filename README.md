# FOSS_-Trainee
FOSS Workshop

Hello my name is Naman Pal and I tried to think for this assignment. I was thinking about thinking to think what to think, and while I was thinking that, I started thinking about how much I was thinking, which made me think whether thinking about thinking was worth the thought I was thinking. Then I thought that maybe I should stop thinking about what I was thinking, but that thought itself was another thought that made me think even more. So I began to think about why I was thinking about not thinking, and that thought led to another thought about how thinking about not thinking is still thinking. By then I was thinking that my thinking had overthought itself into a circle of thoughts where every thought thought another thought before the first one finished thinking. I tried to stop, but even the thought of stopping was a thought that wouldn’t stop, so I kept thinking about thinking until I couldn’t think whether I was still thinking or just thinking that I was thinking about thinking. Finally, I thought it was not worth thinking so much on this assignment.
